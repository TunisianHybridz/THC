Tunisian hybrid car


Project description : 
The project is a robot vehicle to be precised based on an Arduino core ( Arduino UNO) and carrying a Raspberrian independent system for memory consuming operations, and equipped with various tools for environment recon and pen-testing ( GPS/ real-time positioning/live streaming, air plane radar, temperature measurement...)
Project purpose:
A smart car controllable via Internet for long distances and capable of recon current environment and providing scams or doing various networking tasks for penetration testing goals. 
The need for THC :
The need for THC, or the idea of the project come from the fact that we need a remote controllable vehicle in order to manipulate various complicated tasks wether indoor or outdoor without the “must” of one presence nor the need for a controller with a small range.
I-	Why THC:
THC represents a step towards a future where robots may replace humans ,and provide precise multiple-purpose measurements when both time and money factors play an important role 
II-	THC for who  ? 
Being an open-source project, THC is a project for any developer whose concern is upgrading modifying or improving the software part or the hardware of the vehicle, including adding or removing any part of the gear when needed 
III-	THC and IOT 
At the time of writing of this document, there are no real attempts to adapt the THC first version to IOT.
However, due to the project type wich is considered to be included in robotics domain, which itself represents an **** between software and hardware it, won’t be unexpected to grow towards IOT or evolute in manners not Tunisian Hybridz or the writer expects.
IV-	How open source and why ?
The THC project runs based on the mix of both an Arduino ‘Core’ and a Raspberry pi ‘independent system’.
Commonly running a time based OS in the raspb and a compiled C code on the Arduino wich is adopted depending on numerous factors ….
It is unquestionable that , open source may grant benefits to THC as it’s evolution spend is not going to be limited, in any manner by the team…
V-	How cost-efficient ? 
THC is compsed of : a small number of parts pretty much inexpensive and affordable by any startup “rich” enough to buy a computer
